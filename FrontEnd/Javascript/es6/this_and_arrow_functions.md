With regular functions, the value of this is set based on how the function is called. With arrow functions, the value of this is based on the function's surrounding context. In other words, the value of this inside an arrow function is the same as the value of this outside the function.

```javascript
/ constructor
function IceCream() {
  this.scoops = 0;
}

// adds scoop to ice cream
IceCream.prototype.addScoop = function() {
  setTimeout(() => { // an arrow function is passed to setTimeout
    this.scoops++;
    console.log('scoop added!');
  }, 0.5);
};

const dessert = new IceCream();
dessert.addScoop();

```

Since arrow functions inherit their this value from the surrounding context, this code works.

```javascript
// constructor
function IceCream() {
    this.scoops = 0;
}

// adds scoop to ice cream
IceCream.prototype.addScoop = () => { // addScoop is now an arrow function
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.scoops++;
    console.log('scoop added!');
  }, 0.5);
};

const dessert = new IceCream();
dessert.addScoop();

```

this doesn't work - arrow functions inherit their this value from their surrounding context.
Outside of the addScoop() method, the value of this is the global object. So if addScoop() is an arrow function, the value of this inside addScoop() is the global object. Which then makes the value of this in the function passed to setTimeout() also set to the global object
